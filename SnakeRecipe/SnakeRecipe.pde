    direction = "down";

void collision() {

  // If the segment is colliding with a piece of food...
  // Increase the amount of food eaten and set foodX and foodY to new random locations.

 ** Part 2: making the tail (the rest of the snake)

void manageTail() {

  //Call the drawTail and checkTailCollision methods.

  // Add a new Segment to your ArrayList that has the same X and Y as the head of your snake.

  // To keep your tail the right length:
  // while the tail size is greater than the number of food pieces eaten, remove the first Segment in your tail.
}

void drawTail() {
  // Draw a 10 by 10 rectangle for each Segment in your snake ArrayList.
}


// 3. Complete the missing parts of the bodyCollision method below.

  // reset your food variable

  //Call this method at the beginning of your manageTail method.
